4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without affecting existing code

### **For AI Assistance:**
1. **Reduced Context**: Focus on specific features when needed
2. **Clear Boundaries**: Each feature is self-contained
3. **Better Understanding**: Clear feature responsibilities

### **For Team Collaboration:**
1. **Feature Ownership**: Clear boundaries for team members
2. **Independent Development**: Work on features without conflicts
3. **Testing**: Features can be tested in isolation

## 📋 Documentation Created
